# What is JavaChat? What do I do here?

JavaChat is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security, 
it’s super-fast, simple and free. 
You can use JavaChat on all your devices at the same time — your messages sync seamlessly across any number of your phones, tablets or computers.

With JavaChat, you can send messages, photos, videos and files of any type (doc, zip, mp3, etc), as well as create groups for up to 100,000 people or channels for broadcasting to unlimited audiences.
You can write to your phone contacts and find people by their usernames. 
As a result, JavaChat is like SMS and email combined — and can take care of all your personal or business messaging needs. 
In addition to this, we support end-to-end encrypted voice calls.

JavaChat is like Chat, but written in Java ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
